# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code-to-Production Fast Lane is a modern deployment platform designed to eliminate DevOps complexity for students, beginners, and hackathon teams. The platform provides one-click deployment capabilities with automated testing, security scanning, and zero-configuration hosting. By removing technical barriers and preventing common mistakes, the system enables users to focus on building their projects while automatically handling deployment, scaling, security, and portfolio generation.

5. THE Platform SHALL allow Users to customize portfolio URL slugs for professional presentation

### Requirement 6

*User Story:* As a beginner developer, I want the platform to prevent common mistakes automatically, so that my deployments are secure and functional without deep technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Project contains hardcoded API keys or secrets, THE Platform SHALL detect them and prevent deployment
2. WHEN required environment variables are missing, THE Platform SHALL prompt the User to provide them through a secure interface
3. WHEN insecure dependencies are detected, THE Platform SHALL suggest safe alternatives or updated versions
4. WHEN Docker configurations contain common mistakes, THE Platform SHALL auto-correct them or provide specific fix instructions
5. WHEN a Project has misconfigured CORS or security headers, THE Platform SHALL apply secure defaults automatically

### Requirement 7
